# Ques:  Deal or No Deal: You've 10 briefcases. Each case hides a fixed amount of money(given in amounts).
# Some number of cases are opened and removed from play. The banker then makes an offer.

# You must decide : Deal -> If the offer is greater than the expected value( average of remaining unopended cases.)

# "No Deal " -> Otherwise.
