# 🐍 My Python Projects

Welcome to my Python projects collection! 🎯  
This repository showcases a variety of small to medium-sized Python projects that helped me grow as a programmer—from interactive **Pygame animations** to **object-oriented design exercises** and classic **algorithm implementations**.
